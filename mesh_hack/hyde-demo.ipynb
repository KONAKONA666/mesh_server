The intelligent universal plug is suitable for fixing in all building materials. This allows a variety of applications with just one plug. The fischer DuoPower adjusts itself automatically to the building material and transfers the highest loads through the three product functions of folding, expanding and knotting. The very good feedback from the plug when screwing the screw in generates extra security. The fischer DuoPower 6 x 50, 8 x 65 and 10 x 80, because of the larger anchorage depth, are particularly suitable for fixings in hollow building materials, aerated concrete and for bridge plaster.',\n",

The fischer SF plus RC is ideal for fixing plastic insulation pipes in concrete and solid building materials. Two additional pipe clips can be added to the sides of a pre-fixed pipe clip. This saves time and money, and increases flexibility. The pipe clip is secured in the drill hole with the fischer ClipFix plus SD or the fischer Hammerfix N 6. In the case of mounting with the fischer ClipFix plus SD, no further screw is required for the fixing. The plastic pipes are inserted and secured by the pre-tensioning of the pipe clip. The high-quality nylon of the pipe clip provides additional safety.\\nApplications: Flexible and rigid plastic insulating pipes\\nAdvantages: The pipe clip RC can be used with pre-installed clip fixing SD, with Hammerfix N 6 or in 11 mm C-shaped profile-rails, and thus allows for a flexible and cost-effective installation.,The 6 mm-long hole allows for the optimal alignment of the pipe fixing and ensures a more user-friendly installation.,Two additional pipe clips can be added to the sides of a pre-fixed pipe clip.
