Frame fixing FUR with hexagon head	"Frame fixing FUR with hexagon head
The lamella plug with gentle power transfer
The fischer frame fixing FUR consists of a plug sleeve made from high-quality nylon and a hexagonal screw made from zinc-plated steel or stainless steel. When the screw is screwed in, the asymmetrically arranged lamella teeth expand evenly against the wall of the drill hole in the solid building material. In hollow materials, the teeth expand through the solid part of the block and form an undercut in the cavity. The functional principle enables an even load application without extreme expansion pressure and simplifies installation even in the case of an unknown mounting substrate. The FUR is offered in diameters of 8 mm and 10 mm up to a fixing length of 230 mm. The European Technical Approval for the FUR 10 offers added safety. The FUR with hexagonal screw is particularly suitable for the fixing of metal constructions.

Horizontal profiles	"Horizontal profiles
For horizontal load transfer of ventilated rainscreen façades
The horizontal profiles of the subframe systems for ventilated rainscreen façades are made of aluminum. They are used for horizontal load transfer of the occurring loads and pass them on to the next subframe elements. The horizontal profiles are connected to the other subframe elements with system rivets. To allow the thermal expansion of the profile, a differentiation is made between slotted holes (sliding points) and fixed points (round holes) during assembly. The profiles are available in 6 m lengths as standard.

For vertical load transfer of ventilated rainscreen façades
The vertical profiles of the subframe systems for ventilated rainscreen façades are made of aluminum. They are used for vertical load transfer of the occurring loads and pass them on to the next subframe elements. The vertical profiles are connected to the other substructure elements with system rivets. Together with the wall holders and their projection length, the geometry of the vertical profile determines façade offset. This system also enables the compensation of structural tolerances of the building substrate. Direct fixing of façade panels to the vertical profiles can be visibly riveted/screwed or invisibly glued. In addition, the profiles can be used as a distance substructure and as a base structure (e.g. for horizontal systems with concealed fixings). Different geometries allow applications for all cladding materials. The profiles are available in 6 m lengths as standard.

For concealed fixing of façade panels in ventilated rainscreen façades
The clasps are part of the concealed fixing system for ventilated rainscreen façades together with undercut anchors. They are mounted on the undercut anchors which are installed into the façade panel and transfer the loads caused by the façade panels to the horizontal profiles. Thanks to the coordinated geometry, the clasps can be suspended quickly and easily in the horizontal profiles. The two clasps at the top, on the outside, have adjustment screws to adjust the height of the panel and thus create a consistent joint pattern. The clasps are also offered as fixed or sliding points. While the fixed points are fixed by accessories (e.g. clamps or U-profiles), the non-fixed sliding points allow the thermal expansion of the system. The clasps are available in different dimensions. In combination with the fischer undercut anchor, the clasps ensure stress-free fixing of the façade panels.
Applications: As a suspension element in the horizontal profile for subframe systems in rainscreen façades.,As suspension clasps for suspension nuts for pure vertical substructure systems for ventilated curtain walls.
