ABSTRACT = """
Thanks to [tolen](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora), this application runs Alpaca-LoRA which is instruction fine-tuned version of [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/). This demo currently runs 30B version on a 3*A6000 instance at [Jarvislabs.ai](https://jarvislabs.ai/).

NOTE: too long input (context, instruction) will not be allowed. Please keep context < 500 and instruction < 150
"""

BOTTOM_LINE = """
This demo application runs the open source project, [Alpaca-LoRA-Serve](https://github.com/deep-diver/Alpaca-LoRA-Serve). By default, it runs with streaming mode, but you can also run with dynamic batch generation model. Please visit the repo, find more information, and contribute if you can.

Alpaca-LoRA is built on the same concept as Standford Alpaca project, but it lets us train and inference on a smaller GPUs such as RTX4090 for 7B version. Also, we could build very small size of checkpoints on top of base models thanks to [ðŸ¤— transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [ðŸ¤— peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft), and [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/tree/main) libraries.

We are thankful to the [Jarvislabs.ai](https://jarvislabs.ai/) who generously provided free GPU instances.
